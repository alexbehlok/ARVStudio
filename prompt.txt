I am creating an application that will allow me to perform "Associative Remote Viewing" sessions as a single individual.

The program will take on the role of the tasker, randomly assigning images from an image pool to binary outcomes from a chosen event. The program will then guide the viewer through the session, providing a random image from the pool and asking the viewer to describe the image as it relates to the chosen event.

Events will always be binary outcome events, such as sporting events or over/under bets. 

Here is a basic description of the logic flow:

1. Event is chosen from a pre-set list of upcoming events with binary outcomes
2. Two random images are chosen from the image pool and randomly assigned one of the two outcomes.
  - This should result in 4 possible outcomes: 
    - Image 1: Outcome 1
    - Image 1: Outcome 2
    - Image 2: Outcome 1
    - Image 2: Outcome 2  

3. The program will keep this association secret and only provide the user with a randomly generated set of coordinates in the format "xxxxxxxx", an 8 digit number.
4. User will receive target coordinate and perform their remote viewing session.
5. Session is judged and rated against the two images for similarity/correspondence in description:image.
6. If a clear correspondence exists, a prediction is made and the user is informed of the prediction.
7. The prediction is reported to the user
8. The event is observed for feedback
9. Results are recorded and stored for analysis


It will do this by progressing through a series of windows, each with a specific purpose:
* Setup
  - Event Number entered
  -TRN Type (6 or 8 digit Target Result Number)
  - Photo Target Pair Mode:
    Individual photo-target pair for every different viewer even if viewing the same event. (if multiple viewers)
->PROCEED

* Tasking
  -Enter the event information:
    - Event Date: [mm/dd/yy]
    - Event Time: hh:mm
    - Event Timezone: (EST default, CST, PST)
    - Event Type: (Entered by user, IE "NFL Over/Under")
    - Event Pair: (ex: [Ravens]  / [Steelers])
    - Outcomes: (ex: [Over] / [Under])
    - Full Line Info: (Text description of betting line or event details)
  - Save Event
  - Create wording/cue phrasing for the tasking
  - Generate TRN numbers (different for each viewer) randomly. Each viewer should have their image associations done seperately with no image overlap
  - Set Transcript/Session due date
  - Preview view of task email
  - Send Task Email
    
* Judging
  - Start Judging 
  - Each viewer has their sessions compared to the outcome images
